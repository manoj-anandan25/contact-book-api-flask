Got it ‚Äî I‚Äôll treat this like you‚Äôre an **API Support Engineer** explaining your **Contact Book REST API** to a **non-technical audience** (while keeping it clear enough for developers to use).
We‚Äôll also give it a **GitHub repo name** and a **README** that‚Äôs SDK-style with step-by-step usage examples in Python.

## **üìÇ Suggested Repo Name**

`contact-book-api-flask`
*(Clear, descriptive, and searchable ‚Äî includes ‚ÄúAPI‚Äù and ‚ÄúFlask‚Äù for GitHub discoverability.)*

## **üìÑ README.md**

# üìá Contact Book API ‚Äì Flask + SQLAlchemy

A simple RESTful API to manage contact details ‚Äî built with **Flask** and **SQLAlchemy**.

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-book-api-flask.git
cd contact-book-api-flask
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy
```

4. **Initialize the database:**

```bash
python
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```

5. **Run the API server:**

```bash
flask run
```

The API will start at: **[http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)**

## üìù Example API Usage (Python SDK style)

```python
import requests

BASE_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:5000"

# Create a new contact
new_contact = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": 9876543210,
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "address": "123 Main Street"
}
response = requests.post(f"{BASE_URL}/contacts", json=new_contact)
print(response.json())

# Get all contacts
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/contacts")
print(response.json())

# Get a contact by ID
contact_id = 1
response = requests.get(f"{BASE_URL}/contacts/{contact_id}")
print(response.json())

# Update a contact (full update)
updated_contact = {
    "name": "John Updated",
    "phone": 111222333,
    "email": "johnupdated@example.com",
    "address": "456 New Street"
}
response = requests.put(f"{BASE_URL}/contacts/{contact_id}", json=updated_contact)
print(response.json())

# Partially update a contact
partial_update = {"phone": 999888777}
response = requests.patch(f"{BASE_URL}/contacts/{contact_id}", json=partial_update)
print(response.json())

# Delete a contact
response = requests.delete(f"{BASE_URL}/contacts/{contact_id}")
print(response.json())
```

For Non-Technical Users

Think of this **Contact Book API** like a **digital notebook** for storing names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses.
Instead of flipping through pages, you **ask the server** (via API requests) to:

* Add a new contact
* Look up an existing contact
* Update contact details
* Remove a contact you no longer need

If you don‚Äôt write code, you can still use tools like **Postman** to interact with the API by simply clicking and sending requests.

---

 Testing with Postman

1. Open Postman
2. Set the request URL to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/contacts`
3. Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
4. For POST/PUT/PATCH, go to **Body ‚Üí raw ‚Üí JSON** and enter your data:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "phone": 1234567890,
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "address": "456 Another Street"
}
```

5. Send the request and see the response instantly.



Do you want me to create that Postman collection file next?
